Short hair is known for its practicality and ease of maintenance. Animals with short fur are often easier to clean, require fewer grooming sessions, and are more comfortable during warmer seasons. Their coats tend to shed less, which makes them ideal for those with allergies or those who prefer a tidier living space. Short-haired animals are also more agile, allowing them to move swiftly and effortlessly. Their short, sleek fur often highlights their muscular physique and overall healthy appearance.
